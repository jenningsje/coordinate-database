This program will compress all data from the _atom_site.group_PDB loop block
in every crystallographic information file in a directory and store it within
a single csv file.
When you run the program you will be asked to provide a name for the directory
containing all of the crystallographic information data.
Afterwards all the data within the loop block _atom_site.group_PDB loop block
will be stored in a single csv file.
